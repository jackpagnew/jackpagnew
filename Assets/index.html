           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">With this being my only digital-media-oriented class this semester, I’ve had the opportunity to focus my design skills into a singular place. On the other hand, though, that also means that these projects are my only time to practice/explore that realm in my busy schedule. Because of the way it lines up, I have been trying my best to make something worth making every week; to say I’m fostering my creative habits here would be the understatement of the century.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">After a solid few weeks of this semester, I have to say that the workshop style of our class meetings is easily the highlight of the course. Getting a solid chunk of time to bounce ideas off of multiple people has done so much to help me consider my work through the lens of the audience. Project 2 changed from this the most; I was pretty unsure about the direction I had taken but a few constructive critiques helped to make it a much more solid piece.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">In a roundabout way, these projects have encouraged me to tackle simpler ideas in my artistic pursuits. Before, I would overcomplicate an idea in an attempt to make it “worthy” of some higher level of presentation. After a bit of outsider input, however, I have found it much more rewarding to search for inspiration in the mundane/that which is immediately available to me. Challenging my perceptions of what I can choose to invest my efforts into has yielded a much more enjoyable process of creation.</p>

        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">After taking Composing Digital Media, I had one semester before this one - and all of my html and css knowledge was gone. Luckily, the format/prompts of these past three projects has reignited my interest and led me to begin coding more of my own free will. Likewise, I have had the opportunity to learn from the work of others, especially in Project 2. Getting to roam free through all of the internet’s html/css resources taught me very specialized techniques to use in my own projects outside of class.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">I was no stranger to speaking in front of crowds before this class, but after getting thrown on the spot I found it fun to go ahead with really little to no preparation. Especially regarding a website, there’s that challenge of finding the balance between saying and showing. I’m interested to see how the dynamic evolves with video presentations, as they’re a whole different animal.</p>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p>This second phase of the class has been much more hectic - due mostly to my ever-increasing schedule - and finding the time to really let my ideas grow has been a struggle. That being said, I think the situation has forced me to brainstorm with much more intention and purpose. Where I would normally let my thoughts float around for a period of time until something interesting happened, I now sit down and get right to work. While this method would be detrimental in an extreme form, I think a big aspect of being successful in creative fields is actually being able to produce something from one’s creativity. Hopefully, this has been an important skill to acquire for my workflow.
</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p>As time has gone on this semester, I have become more and more comfortable with my fellow students in the workshop portions of the class. I find myself being inspired by their work, which ultimately makes my work better, which hopefully feeds back into the cycle to somebody else. Not to mention, I’ve begun workshopping some ideas for my creative work outside of this class with a few students - a relationship I imagine will be a great help to all involved parties.
</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p>During this phase of the class, I’ve been having a bit of a “less is more” adventure; especially with the prompts. Only being able to use still images in cracksinthesurface.mp4, only having text and effects for the title animations, even being confined within the Adobe Character Creator - all of these constraints forced me to take a different angle than I usually would in my creative work. These challenges have inspired some of (what I consider) my best work overall in video/video editing - not just my best work within this class.
</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p>Video, and to a lesser extent animation, are definitely skills much more in my wheelhouse than html/css, so beginning this part of the portfolio had me bursting with ideas. By some random luck, I also had recently acquired some new equipment around that time - and these two factors combined in the best way. Through these projects, I am now much more capable of transferring the ideas in my head into a tangible product via the new gear, and have successfully regained the practice with Premiere/After Effects I had been lacking (for a couple months at this point).</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p>During the first phase (and even the start of this one), I did a lot of talking. I mean, a lot. And while we already talked about it in a class period, I think I’ve made improvement in the way of not trying to “hog the stage”. Being comfortable speaking publicly is all well and good, but it’s arguably even better to find the balance of practicing that skill while letting the room breathe every now and then. I’ll have my time again for a (very long and nerve-inducing) 10 minutes soon.</p>

 <div class="container-fluid bg-b text-center">
  <h3>Phase 4 Course Goals</h3> <br>
  <h4><em>1.	Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p>Upon rethinking my project during the research phase, I had to rack my brain to keep the theme of a band website while also meeting the parameters of a touchscreen kiosk. I believe the result I landed on is a very creative method of getting across the information I intended via a fun, interactive experience for the user. The assignment really forced me to think outside the box, and I’m glad I did; the product is better than I could’ve hoped.</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p>While I say I thought outside the box, it wasn’t just me. The nature of the class allowed me to look to my fellow students for feedback, and I wouldn’t have been able to narrow my ideas without their input. Likewise, getting to test the user experience via my peers helped a great deal in ensuring the kiosk experience was cohesive and, essentially, just made sense. Without their input, I would essentially be shooting in the dark.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p>Not only did I have to take time and debate my kiosk’s content, but I also had to put myself in the mindset of the user. Designing a site such as this required a lot of consideration regarding user experience, and made me create each aspect very, very meticulously. The attention to detail required made me focus more than I ever have on a site, and ensured that each step was completed with purpose (as opposed to brainlessly writing out code - which I would… never do…)</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development</em></h4>
  <p>The idea I settled on for my kiosk was… a lot, to say the least. I have just about 0 JavaScript experience, and didn’t even know what an image map was before November. The project absolutely tested the limits of my coding ability - requiring many YouTube tutorials and walkthrough articles - but I’m very satisfied with the final product. Moving forward, I’m going to be able to tackle a lot more, bigger projects when it comes to coding; I’d say I’ve developed my skills quite a bit. </p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p>There was a lot of presenting to do towards the end of this class, and I feel as though I delivered much better than I expected to. I have never felt so comfortable with talking for nearly 10 minutes straight on a PowerPoint, but I have to think that all of the work during the rest of the semester had me adequately prepared. When it came to the kiosks, it was a bit of a weird adjustment figuring out what to say for myself and what to leave to the actual experience, but nonetheless I hope I adjusted adequately. Overall, I’m glad to look back at the progress I’ve made with presenting my work - regardless of the medium on display.</p>
