  <h2>Hey! I'm Jack!</h2>
  <p class="bio">...and you will not find <em>anybody</em> with more passion or determination than myself.
After nearly a year as a Videographer for WTOV News 9, I'm hoping to advance my career to the next step. While I may not have as many years of job experience on my resume,
I can assure you that I've been filming, editing, writing, and producing for nearly a decade. Through teaching myself, and taking every opportunity to learn something new,
I've gathered a robust knowledge of audio/video production - a knowledge I've been able to refine and expand through my time with WTOV. Now, I'm hoping for an opportunity
to push myself even further, and accept any new challenges to make my work even better.</p>
